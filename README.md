xkcd-news-substitions
=============

work in progress. 

[Direct download of crx file](//github.com/colllin/xkcd-news-substitions/blob/master/XKCD-News-Substitions.crx?raw=true)

Note that there are forks of this extension that simply replace 'cloud' with 'butt'.
In my personal opinion, that approach is too broad and it's less funny as a result, but it is clearly a very
polarizing issue in my butt-to-butt user community.  Forks are free to do whatever they like.  But officially, _this_
extension replaces only the phrase described above. Thank you for your concern.

Installation
------------

In Chrome, choose Window > Extensions.  Drag XKCD-News-Substitions.crx into the page that appears.
